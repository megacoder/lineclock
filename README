LineClock - desktop clock shaped in the form of line
 LineClock uses representation of time as a straight line.
 Sometimes it's handy to see what event would take place in
 half an hour as a point on time line. And here it is.
 Events may be set by clicking on time line or by editing them
 in a dialog.

==Requirements==
  Python 2.5+ (http://python.org)
  PyGTK 2.12+ (http://pygtk.org)
  pynotify    (http://www.galago-project.org)

Also some console audio player is needed to play alarm sound.
aplay or mplayer should be good

==Installation==
run (as root)
python setup.py install

LineClock can be run without installation, just run lineclock.py

==Config==
User config is placed in
$HOME/.config/lineclock.conf

Config has 4 sections

===[widget] Section===
type - either H or V. Defines orientation of time line: horizontal or
	vertical
timerange - length of time line, in seconds
nowrel - number from 0.0 to 1.0. Position of Now on time line
tickgap - distance between labeled ticks, in seconds
ntick - number of ticks between labeled ones
ltr - if 1, time raises left-to-right/up-to-down. If -1 otherwise.
	Other values are not allowed
main_w - width of time line. from 0 pixels to infinity =)
now_w - width of Now line
long_w - width of labeled ticks
short_w - width of simple ticks
marker_w - width of markers that mean events on time line
now_h - 2 numbers in brackets, delimited by comma. numbers mean
	start and end of Now line, measured downwards/leftwards
	from time line. Negative number means upper than time line.
	Order is not important. Pixels
long_h - the same for labeled ticks
short_h - for simple ticks
marker_h - for markers
label_fmt - format of labels, that is used in time.strftime
label_x - horizontal distance from label center to time line
label_y - vertical distance from label center to time line
pos_tolerance - number of pixels that defines if position on time
	line is considered as marker
gtkrc - name of rc file, see below

===[window] Section===
decorated - if True, window has frame
keep_below - self explaining
sticky
skip_pager
skip_taskbar
opacity - from 0.0 to 1.0
x - position of window
y - position of window
length - if type=H it's window width, if type=V it's height

===[alarm] Section===
player - command used as audio player. aplay or mplayer should be good
file - sound file to play

===[misc] Section===
tooltip_fmt - time format used in tooltips

==gtkrc==
The look of LineClock is modified via gtkrc file. Path to this file is
defined in section [widget] of config file. gtkrc file looks like

pixmap_path "."
style "lineclock" {
  xthickness = 1
  ythickness = 1
  font_name = "11"

  fg[NORMAL] = "#02158f"	# main line and ticks
  fg[ACTIVE] = "#91bef2"	# now line
  #fg[PRELIGHT] = "green"	# not used
  fg[SELECTED] = "#bababa"	# markers
  fg[INSENSITIVE] = "#4e8eda"	# labels new

  bg[NORMAL] = "#150926"	# background
  #bg_pixmap[NORMAL] = "background.png"
}
widget "*lineclock-widget" style "lineclock"

Colors of various lines, labels and background are defined here.
You may specify background image instead of plain color. font_name
parameter affects labels. xtickness and ythickness define margins
around time line.
